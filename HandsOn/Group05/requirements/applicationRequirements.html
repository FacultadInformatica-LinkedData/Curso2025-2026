   <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>FR1. The app will display a simple and understandable air quality index (with colors and text labels) along with a health recommendation (“avoid intense outdoor exercise”) and a specific note for sensitive groups (children, elderly, people with asthma).</p>
  <p>FR2. Each card will indicate which pollutant triggers the alert, the time of the last measurement, and the distance to the station used.</p>
  <p>FR3. A short explanation of what the thresholds mean (WHO/EU references) will be provided, avoiding technical jargon.</p>
  <p>FR4. Acceptance criteria: the user understands in ≤15 seconds whether “today is a good/bad day” for outdoor activities and why; source, time, and station are always visible.</p>
  <p>FR5. The app will display a map that shows the city with different indications of the corresponding air qualities on different parts of the city.</p>
  <p>FR6. A signal will be sent to the user whenever the app detects an increase in bad air quality on the area where the user resides or is located.</p>


   <h2> Non Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>NFR1. The use of location will be optional, with explicit consent and easy withdrawal.</p>
  <p>NFR2. A manual selection of neighborhood/address will be available without sharing location.</p>
  <p>NFR3. Data minimization will be applied: only what is necessary for alerts will be used; a clear and visible privacy policy will explain purpose, duration, and data sharing.</p>
  <p>NFR4. The user will be able to turn alerts on/off and adjust sensitivity (e.g., “only high alerts” vs. “moderate and high alerts”).</p>
  <p>NFR5. The user can configure silent hours (do not disturb), frequency of alerts, and scope (current location, home, work).</p>
  <p>NFR6. Content will be written in clear language, available at least in Spanish and English.</p>
  <p>NFR7. Icons and text will have good contrast and alternatives for color-blind users.</p>
  <p>NFR8. The app will always show official data source, reuse license, date/time of update, station used, and known limitations.</p>
